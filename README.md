# Assignment 2
In this assignment, I was responsible for implementing a simple seq2seq model, without attention, with single-headed attention, and with multi-headed attention-based. I also trained the models with teacher-forcing and decoded using beam search. 
You can view my analysis [here](A2/analysis.txt) and the assignment's file [here](A2/a2.pdf).


# Assignment 3
In this assignment I was responsible for implementing Gaussian mixture modeling, recurrent neural networks with acoustic data, and completing three basic tasks for speaker identification and speech recognition.
